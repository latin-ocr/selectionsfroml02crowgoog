bandry‚ the growth of plants and trees, and the ways of floclrs and herds in
their pastures; or, again, some foretaste of the modern passion for the moun·
tains; while the mention of companionship in some of his mountain wanderings
and in other scenes enables us to think of him as not separated from other men

ln the daily intercourse of life by an unsocial austerity.
¹¹ His dominant impulse is the ardent desire to emancipate human life from

the fears and passione by which it is marred and degraded; and he has more
of the zeal of a religious reformer than any other ancient thinker except
Socrates. It is the constant presence of this practica] purpose, and the pro-
found sense which he has of the actual misery and degradation of human life,

η and of the peace and dignity which are attainable by man, that impart to his

words the peculiar tone of impassioned earnestness to which there is no parallel
in ancient literature.

‘⁸ In various passages appears his consciousness both of the greatness of the
work on which he was engaged and of his own power to eope with it. With·
out disowning the passion for fame, he manifests great delight in the exercise
of his art, and revcals the thoroughness and devotion of a student, and the
absorhing interest with which he carried on the work of inquiry and of com·
position. ⁴

“In his fortitude, his superiority to human wealmess‚ his seriousness of
spirit, his dignity of bearing, he seems to embody the great Roman qualities,
constantia and gravitas. But he also combines a poetic freshness of feeling, a
love of simple living, an independence of the world with a tenderness and
breadth of sympath y and a· power of sounding into the depths of human sorrow
such as only a very few among the ancients- Homer¹ Sophocles, Virgil-and
not many among the poets or thinkers oi the modern world have displayed. lrt
no quality does he rise further above¹ the standard of his age than in his abso-
lute sincerity and his unswerving devotion to truth.'’

The De Rerum Natura of Lucretius is a didactic poem in hex·
ameter verse in six Boolts3 which was left at his death unfinished‚
as Lachmann has proved.

From Jerome's statement aliquot libros quos postea Cicero emen·
davit, it has been supposed that Cicero both corrected it and super-
intended its publication; and a passage in Cicero's letter* to his

Ncarlyall editors insert nou before multis. Instead of this, Munro suggests tha
change of sed cum verteris to esse cum inveneris ‚¹ or, if non should be inserted at all,
he (and Sellar also) would place it before multae, or would insert eft'ctm before artis.
Munro and Sellar are also of the opinion that the Ms. reading may be currem. and that
the passage may be a short snmmin g up of some criticism of Quintus, thtts: [agree rotet
