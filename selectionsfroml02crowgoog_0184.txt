Lucretius. 171

brother Quintus, oi February, 54 u.c., shows that he had read the
poem, and (is the letter is correctly interpreted by Munro and
Sellar) that he had a high appreciation of the genius of its author.
But respecting the question of Cicero's editorship there has been a
good deal oi discussion and doubt. Munro (Lucretius, p. 293·.300)
maintains the affirmative of the question. Cruttwell (Hist. Μυκη.
Iit.. p. 221) holds to the negative. Sellar (p. 278-281) argues both
sides of the case, aud ‘⁸ suspends judgment.'’

The object ‹rstlris poem of Lucretius wrm to interpret the meaning
aud explain the operations of the power underlying and producing
all natural pheuomena in those spherus of action that most directly
effect human welfare. ln particular: lt aims to free rnen from a

the senseS‚ the passion of love, and the images thrown off frorn all
bodies. The fifth explains the origin os the heavens, of the earth,
oi vegetable and animal life upon it, and the origin and the progress
ol mankind [τοττι the primitive savage state to the arts and usages of
civilization. The sixth (which is also unfinished) describes and
accounts ior certain natural pheuomena-earthquakes, volcanoes,
tempests, thunder-storms, etc, and ends with an account of the
memor-able plague at Athens.
