140 Notes.

Early in the year 57 Bc„ prompted by a desire lor foreign trave
in congenial society, and perhaps to better his lortunes‚ he went t<
Bithynia on the staff ol the PropraetorMemmius, remained there until
the next spring. then made a tour through some ol the famous cities ol
Asia, visited his brother's grave in the Troad, and returned to ltaly.

His death is believed to have occurred in the year 54 B.c., the
year ol Caesar's second invasion of Britain and of Crassus* expedi·
tion against the Parthians, about a year later than the death of the
poet Lucretius, and near the time of the publication ol Cicero's la
Oratore and De Legibus.

Catullus was the earliest Latin writer of lyric and elegiae poetry
and epigram. The extant collection ol his poems contains a hun·
tired and sixteen pieces in various metres and ol varying length
from two to lour hundred and eight lines, not arranged however in
the order of composition or by subjects.

The first sixty are short lyrical or satiric pieces in phalaecian,
glyconic, or satiric verse. Among the lyricS, which are the linest
os all his productions‚ some os the most beautiful are the dedication
ol his yacht, the verses upon Sirmio and upon his departure from
Bithynia, the festival hymn to Diana, his welcome to Veranius, thr
Acme and SeptimiuS, and those upon the sparrow of “Lesbia,'
whose real name was Clodia (a sister of the notorious tribunt
Clodius). Several of his other poems also are addressed to her,
and record his ardent passion, estrangement, partial reconciliation,
and final renunciation.

The next eight poems (LXI-LXVIII) are longer productioris ol
amore purely artistic character, in hexameter, glyconic, and elegia(
verse3 os which the most noted are the two epz'tlzalamia or marriage
songS, the epyllzon or heroic idyl, describing the mythical wedding
ol Peleus and Thetis, and those which give expression to his griel
at the death ol his brother.

The remainder are epigrams and other short pieces in elegia(
metre. Two ol the latter, one addressed to Calvus on the loss ol
Quintilia and the other on visiting his brother's grave, are especially
remarkable lor their pathos and beauty. More than half of thr
epigrams, as wellas many in the first group (poems I-LX), art
satiric in character, and among these are the pieces which havi
been so justly censured for their indecencies and their coarse, seur
rilous personalities.
