retain a strong admiration for its noble imperfectioris. ln description Lucan
is excellent both in action and still life, but more in brilliancy oi detail than in
broad effects. ile has a true opinion of the importance of the Civil War,
which he judges to he the final crisis of Rome's history and its issues fraught
with superhuman grandeur. ln splendid extravagance of expression no Latin
author comes near him. Some of his lines embody a condensed trenchant
vigor which has made them proverbs. Phrases lilre Trahimur sub nomine
pacis-Momentumque fieit mutatus Caria rerum, recall the pen of Tacitus.
Others are finer still, Caesar's encrgy is rivalled by the line-Nil actum cre-
dens dum quid superesset agendum. The duty of securing liberty, even at the
cost of blood, was never more finely expressed than hythe noble words:
Ignoratque datas ne quisquam serviat enses. Curio's treachery is pilloried in
the epigram, Emere amnes, liic uendidit Urbem. The nringled cowardice and
folly of servile obedience is nobly expressed by his reproach to the people:
Usque adeone times, quem tu sacis ipse timendum.

¹¹ instead of the inextricable harmonies of Virgil's cadence, we have a suc-
cession of rich, forcible, and polished monotonous lines, rushing on without a
thought of change until the period closes The same caesuras recur again and
again, and the only merit of his rhythm is its undeniable originality.''

“The Pharsalia is defaced with great faults and blemishesi It is disfigured
by cornmonplace maxims, pompous diction, an affectation of learning, and a
rhetorical exuberance, which outstripped its subjects. But at the same time
it possesses peculiar beauties. lts subject is a noble one and full of historic
interest, and is treated with spirit, brilliance, and animation. lts arrangement
is that of annals, and therefore it wants the unity of an epic poem; it has not
the connectedness of history, because the poet naturally selected only the most
striking and romantio incidents, and yet notwithstanding these defects in the
plan, the historical pictures themselves are beautifully drawn. The characters
of Cacsar and Pompey, for example, are masterpieces. Our admiration of
Lucan is called forth¹ not by considering his poem as an epic, but for the sake
of isolated soenes, such as the naval victory off Marscilles; splendid descrip-
tions‚ such as that of the cruelties of Marius and Sulla; felicitous comparisons,
that for example of Pompey to an aged oalr, and the epigrammatic terseness
which gives force as well as beauty to his sayings.''-B1t0w1vu.

“The brief and pregnant criticism of Quintilian-Lucanus ardens et corr·
citatus et sententies clarissimus et magis oratoribus qaam poetis imitandus (10, l,
90) -suggests at once the chief merits and defects of Lucan as a poet. The
latter may be said to belong as much to the age as to the author. The
same predominance of declamation, the same over-fondness for minute and
often painful description, the same want of real, with exuberance of spas-
modic, feeling, the same parade of erudition and moralizing sententiousness,
that were noticed in the plays of Seneca, pervade the Epic of Lucan. On the
other hand, the vigor and originality, the boldness and fertility of his genius,
stamp him as a man of great powers and claim for him a very high rank among
the poets of the Silver Age. Fine delineation of character, noble sentimenta
