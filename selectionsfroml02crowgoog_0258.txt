Au elegy on the death of Cornelia, in the form of an address to
her husband, exhorting him to cease his lamentations for her,
affirming the blamelessness of her life, pleading ber cause before
Aeacus and the court of Hades, summoning witnesses to attest her
virtues addressing also her children and commending their father
to their care3 and asking for admission to the abode of her distin-
guished ancestors in Hades as a recompense due to her merits.

“The plan of the poem, which is a sort oi funeral oration in verse, is not

brother. Her husband Paullus Aemilius Lepidus, a nephew of the
triumvir of that name, was an officer in the Republican army. but
afterwards joined Octavian, was consul rac. 34, and censor nc. 22.
Their children were L. Aemilius Paullus, consul aa). r, aasentias
Lepidus consulas). 6, and Aemilia Lepida, of whom nothing is
known. As Cornelia died nc. 16, it has been inferred that this was
the latest of Propertius' productions‚ as it is certainly the master·
piece of his genius and (in the estimation of most critics) one of
the fmest poems in the language. Paley speaks of it as “a splendid
composition full of pathos and eloquent appeal‚ and on the whole
worthy of the almost extravagant praises which Barth ancl liuinoel
have bestowed upon its*
