— 26. annus, ie. the poem on the year. ⁰

Vs. 27-62 form the introduction to the poem.

27. Tempora . . . suo. lu very early times the Roman year consisted
of 304 days, divided into ten months, beginning with March. This was
succeeded by a pure lunar year of twelve months, according to Ovid
(lv, 30, 31), January being added at the beginning of the year, and Febru-
ary at the eud, and the latter being put into the second place, afterwards,
by the Decemviri ,· but according to other accounts, both January and
February being added at the end of the year. The former month,therefore,
may have been originally called after Janus, not because it was the first
month in the year, hut because it was the month which immediately iol-
lowed the winter-solstice, when the sun may be said to resume his career.

The epoch, however, at which January and February became the first
and second months, there is no satisfactory evidence to determine. After
tac. 154 the consuls always entered upon their office on the 1st of January,
and after tac. 46 that day was assumed as the calendar period for begin·
ning the year.

At what time any system of intercalation was first brought into use is
not known3 but the intercalations were made in the mouth of February
between the 23d and the 24th.

The prerogative of adjusting them was in the hands of the Pontifices,
who lengthened or shortened the year, at pleasure, until the whole calen-
dar was involved in the greatest uncertainty and confusion, and the civil
year was about two months in advance of the seasons. Caesar, in the year
46 tac, by the insertion of two intercalary months between November and
December, besides the ordinary intercalation in February, rectified the
error and established the solar year and the Julian calendar. See Ry, pp.
