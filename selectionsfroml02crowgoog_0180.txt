xn] Catullus. 167

the solemn words of forewell to the dead, uttered at the conclusion of the
inseriae.

‘¹ Brother! o'er many lands and oceans borne,
l resch thy grave, death's last sad rite to pay3
To cnll thy sifent dust in vain, and rnourn¹
Since ruthless fate has hurried thee away:
Woe's mel Yet now upon thy tomi) Ι lay,
ΑΙ] soaked with tears for thee, thee lored so well,
What gitis our fathers gave the honored clay
Of valued friends: take thern, my grief they tell:
And now, for ever hailt for ever fare-thee-wefl t '¹ - CRAttsmUN.

‘Catullus' words in reference to this great sorrow, in nit the ros in which
hcspcaks of ii, are tutt of deep and simple human feeling. c does not ven-
tnreto comfort himself with the hope, which hc suggests to Calvus in the lines
on the death of Quintilio¹ of a conscrous existence after death: but he resolves
haghis love shall still endure even after the eterna} separation froin its object.”
