1. Tus Marnas or Curemus.

1. Euromo Drsrrcir. A. 3⁶33 G. 7⁶²3 H. 615. In fifty-two poems=
Carne. 65-116.

'⁴ Ovid's rules, such as the close os a thought with a couplet, the avoidance
of elision, especially in the latter hall both ol the hexameter and the pentameter,
the preponderanee os dactyls‚ the ending oi the couplet with a dissyllable, which
must be either noun or verb, or mellite, were not observed by Catullus.'' Su.

11. Pulchram Hunnucnsvumuuu. A. 371, 11; G. 7653 H. 629, 1.
Τὴε lirst foot is usually a spondee, sometimes a trochee or iambus. The
tribrach occurs once (C. 55, ιο). In the second loot a spondee is allowed
to alternate more or less regularly with the usual dactyl. In forty poenis:

earm. 1-3, 5-7‚ 9, 10, 12-16, 21, 23, 24, 26-28, 52, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40-43,
— 0, - .

45 ihesihiiaecian has no fixed caesura. The most common is that after

the arsis ol the second loot, or aster the arsis of the third loot.

⁴¹ Four lyrical metres were elaborated by Catullus and thus made popular,-
the hendecasyllabic, the pure iambic, the scazon. and the glyconio—and in
them he was not surpassed by any later poet. The greater part ol his lyrics
were written in the hendecasyllable. The freedom ol cadence in this measure,
the varied caesura and the licenses in the lirst loot give the charin ol irregular
beauty, so sweet lu itsell and so rare in Latin poetry; and theth hm lends
itsell with equal ease to playful humor, fierce satire, and tendet ection. ln
the management ol the scazon he was also very skillul.” Es.

111. Iulmtc VuRsE. In twelve poems.
1. lambit Trimeter or Senarius. A. 3653 G. 754; H. 622. In

Carm. 4, 29, 52. ln these the pure iumbic loot alone isused‚ with the '

exception of C. 52, vs. 2, 3, both ol which begin with a spondee. In C.
4 and 29 the coincidence ol verbal and metrical accent is remarkable.

2. Choliambrer or Scason. A. 365‚c; G. 7553 H. 622, 4. Itdiffers
l‘rom the ordinary trimeter by having always a spondee or a trochee in the
