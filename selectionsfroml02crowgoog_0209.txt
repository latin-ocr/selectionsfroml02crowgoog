The four authors who cultivated elegiae poetry in the Augustan
age are thus grouped together by Ovid (Trist. lV, 10):

'¹ nec amara Tibullo
Tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.
Successor fuit hic tibi, Galle; Propertius itti;
Quartus ab his serie temporis ipse fui.”

Respecting these writers and the relative excellence of Roman
elegy the criticism of Quintilian is as follows: “Elegia quoque
Graecos provocamus, cuius mihi tersus atque elegans maxime vide-
tur auctor Tibullus. Sunt qui Propertium malint. Ovidius utroque
lascivior, sicut durior Gallus.” X, 1, 93.

Of the four Books of elegies which bear the name of Tibullus, the
third is generally believed to be the work of some younger contem·
porary and imitator, who also belonged to the circle of Messala.
The genuineness of the first poem in Book fourth, the panegyric on
Messala, has also been denied. Milman thinks it cannot be ascribed
to a writer of the exquisite taste of Tibullus, and Cruttwell takes the
same view. But Teuffel regards it as “representing the poet's
Alexandrine period, and as attesting a certain talent but unripe
taste.” The authorship of the thirteen remaining pieces of that
Book — elegn'dia ascribed to the lovers Cerinthus and Sulpicia -has
been also a matter of dispute. Cranstoun ascribes poems 7-12
inclusive, to Sulpicia— supposed to have been a poetess of the circle
of Messala— and the rest to Tibullus. Teuffel seems to agree with
him. Pinder's judgment is that “ the smaller elegies of the fourth
Book, if not by Tibullus, have many of the characteristics of iris
geniuS,'' and Milman'S, that “they have all the inimitable grace and
simplicity of this poet.” Cruttwell thinks “ that the finished elegance
and purity of diction of these pieces are easily reconciled with the
view that they are the work of Tibullus3 at the same time the
description of Sulpicia as a poetess (in vi, 23 vii, 3) seems to
point to her as the authoress of the pieces that bear her name.
And the materials for coming to a decision are so scanty that it
seems best to leave the authorship an open question.”

The elegies of Tibullus have been divided into Amatory, Rural,
Deuotional, and Partqurical, but many of them partake of all these
qualities, and few of thern belong strictly to either of these classes
alone. While in variety of subjects and vigor of thought he was
inferior to both his rivals (the works of Gallus are not exiam), lte
