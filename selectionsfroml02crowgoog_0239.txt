of two serry-boats for the dead in V, vii, 55:

¹¹ Nam gemina est sedes turpem sortita per amnem,
Turbaque diversa remigat omnis aqua.
Una Clytaemnestrae stuprum vehit, altera Cressae
Portat mentitae lignea monstra bovis.
Ecce coronato pars altera vecta phaselo,
Mulcet ubi Elysias aura beata rosas,

Qua numerosa fides, quaque aera rotunda Cybebes
Mitratisque sonant Lydia plectra choris.''

and voyages for making our fortunes, hereafter we shall be stripped of
everything, and see only the ships on the infernal river. Thus aelii ad
rates is sim'ply la de serried aver ta tlte steel.” 1³12, following Hertzberg,
reads at inferna rate, and remarks: “velsere is the natural word for being
carried in but not carried ta the boat. Resides, the preceding line places
the dead soul at the waters ς the following one must apply to its crossing.'’
