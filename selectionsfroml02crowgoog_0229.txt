216 Notes.

‘⁴ In vigor and originality of conception, in richness aud variety of coloriug,
nay, ln the very quality and compass of imagination, Propertius leaves thern far

behind.”

“ ΤΙιε poetry of Propertius forms a striking contrast with that of his contem-
porary Tibullus. While the latter is simple, popular, national, aud religious,
Propertius is artificial, erudite, foreign, and mythological. Though not without
Roman strength, maJesty, and patriotic sympathy with'the destinies of his
country, yet his intimate knowledge of Greek poetry, his love of Greek art 3ηά
legend, his power of throwing himself into the situations and soenes of other
lands, impart a foreign coloring to his thought, style, 3ηά expression.

“His elegies are crowded with metaphors and figures; his impassioned out-
bursts and abrupt appeals, combined with a straining after artificial phrases,
forced constructions, and condensed expressions, frequently make his meaning
obscure, though they impart liveliness and variety to the poet's style, which con-
trasts powerfully with the even and lucid monotony of Tibullus. His Greek
erudition also displays itself in the parade of a recondite mythology to a greater
degree than is found in any other Latin poet.''-P1NDER.

“Propertius sang the sweet, sad story of his love, the time-hoary legends of
Rome, the praises of Maecenas and the glory of Augustus, the untimely fates
of Paetus and the young Marcellus, the devoted affection of Aelia Galla and
the stainless honor of Cornelia—giving to Roman elegy a freshness 3ηά variety
hitherto unknown.

“And no one who has read him, even cursorily, requires to be told how
powerful an instrument elegiae verse became in hls hands, as well for descrip-
tive purposes as for the delineation of the master-passion in its varied phases
of tendemess, ecstasy, grief, jealousy, and despair. ln the poetry of pure pas·
sion he is second to Catullus alone. He lacks the sweet grace and tender
melanchon that lend such an exquisite charm to the elegies of Tibullus, and
the easy flow and melodicus chimes that lead us lovingly along in Ovid; but
his verse has a strength and vigor and sparkle, to which they even in their
happiest efforts can lay no claim. No poet ever more completely threw bis
soul into the music of his verse; every line reflects the man. Hence his
originality is always unquestionable, his utterances sincere, his pathos genuine.

‘⁴ Learned in the literature and steeped in the charming mythology of Greece,
Propertius everywhere in his works presents traces of Greek culture, archaeo-
logical research, 3ηά that exquisite retinement and polish which are the result
of long and laborious study. His myths are frequently obscure, 3ηά he is apt
to use Greek forms of expression a little too ostentatiously; his style is admit-
tedly difficult, 3ηά his meaning often not at first apparent. But his metaphors
are uniformly apt and beautiful; his language strong, nervous, and brilliant;
and his antitheses singularly pointed,-traits which constitute, with those who
have been long and intimately conversant with his works, his greatest 3ηά most
delightfulcharm. Not rarely he gives usaperfect picture in asingle line. And,
all things considered, he may fairly he ranked among the greatest poets of tlte
augustan age.” - Cunnsroun.
