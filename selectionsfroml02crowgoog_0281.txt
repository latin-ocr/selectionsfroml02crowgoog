ways. Just outside the gate and to the right oi it was an ancient temple
oiJanus. dextra. So the Mss, Merkel, Hm, and Py, who paraphrases
as follows: There is a passage through rae Carmental gate, nexta tlte
temple af Janus: that passage is unlucky,· take the other on the lest.
dextra, the conjecture of Heinsius, is preferred by Gierig‚ Ky, and Ry,
who interprets: “ T lie nearest way is through the rigla Janus of the Car·
mental gate, ie. the right one oi the three archways, of which many oi the
ancient gates consisted, the middle one ior the sake of security being
ordinarily kept closed. Those who went out would naturally take the
Janus on their right; the contrary must have been the practice at the
Carmenta] gate, and Ovid here explains the anomaly.''
