power and 11 governing 1101101,Ᾰο many passages. 10 many places, too, the
imagination, which recognitas the presence 01 infinite 1110 and harmony in the
1101111, endows the great forces 01 11115 mysterious power with personal and
1111111011 qualities-consciousness and will. This is done with the 1100050 indeed
01 poetry, but yet with an uneonscious acknowledgment 01 50100 attribute analo·
1005 10 will, in a power independent 01 0011 superior to 0111ος as in the invoca-
tion, where it is identified with the goddess 01 love. The expressions rerum
11011110,11111111111 rerum,etc., are often used to denote this power-the all-per-
vading source 0111101110 creator and sustainer 01 all order and beauty.

'¹ This doctrine 01 Lucretius, though antagonistic to the popular religion, is
not atheistic nor pantheistic; it is not definite enough to hc theistic. lt is rather
1110 twilight between an old and a new iaith. The new attributes he attaches to
nature, as an organic whole, are independent 01 and ultimately inconsistent with
the principles 01 1110 0100110 philosophy. The higher conception 01 God was
neither consciously accepted nor consciously denied by him. So, there is in
bis 11011101 01 1110 popular saith the latent germ 01 a higher and 01010 rational
1101101. 'lhe sense 01 will, active 10100 and individual 1110, 0101 present in the
poem, comes nearer to an uneonscious, hali-realized theism than 1ο 1110 panthe-
lstic conception 01001010 and 01 human 111 ,

“The human soul or vital principle, Lucretius toaches, is material ,· com·
posed 01 1110 110051 010015, but born and growing with the body, united with it
as perfume with incense, and perishing with it. lt is made up 01 two parts-
the animus situated in the breast, the 0111100 united with it, but diffused through
1110 whole body. The animus is like 1110 pupll 01 1110 eye, the least hurt to which
drsuoys the sight; the animo is like the rest 01 1110 eyehall, much 01 which may
110 cut away and the sight continue.

“th ethicul teuchings of Lucretius 010 moulded by this 111011 01 law in
nature. Th0ugh the 101111005011110 0011 individual characteristica are the 0110015
nithe varied combinations 01 010015, yet when once reason and knowledge have
resulted they make man capable 01110011010 0011111100; which he actually
11110105 by conformity to the order 0011 law 01 1110 00110150, and has thus the
power to live a 1110 worthy 01 1110 gods.

‘⁴ He therefore insists 00 11115 obedience as the one good which man needs,
and as producing the real pleasure which Epicurus taught was 1110 truc end 01
1110. ‘Lite may go on without corn or wine, but not without a pure heart.'

1011.Ι He therefore delineates and illustrates the evils 01 1110 passions to which
meu were most subject in his age-ambition, grced 01 wealth, 11011 50050111
pleasure. No sentiment is 111010 powcriully enloreed than the happiness 11011
dignity 01 plain living, 1110 inability 01 1101105 and luxury to give real cujoyment,
aad the terrible evils they had often brought upon men's errarat-tere and he
