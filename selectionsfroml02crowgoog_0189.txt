particles of transition, and in the painful precision, which at times leaves
nothing 1ο the imagination of the reader. But his vocabulary is not prosaic;

The ioy of gods and men, that under skre
Doest fayrest shine, and most adorne thy place;

The raging seas, and makst the stormes to fite,
And, when thou spredst thy mantle forth on hie,
Tire waters play, and pleasant lands appeare, υ
And heavens laugh, and al the world shows toyons chaace.
