Ι.
uns Episne is supposed to ua addressed by Laodamia, the

daughter of AcastuS, to her husband Protesilaus the son of Iphiclus
of Phylace in Thessaly, the chief who led against Troy the men of
several Thessalian towns. (fland. ΙΙ, 698-702.)

While the host was still at Aulis, Laodamia heard of an oracle to
the effect that the first man of the Greeks who should touch Trojan
soil would be immediately killed, and she writes to warn her husband
of it. and to dissuade him from exposing himself to this fate.

Notwithstanding the oracle, Protesilaus on reaching the shore of
“ Troy leaped from his bark, far the foremost of all the Achaeans‚ and
was slain by a Dardanian wardon-according to one tradition, by

Hector.
Cf. Wordsworth's Poems ofthe [maginarium XXXI, ‘⁶ Laodamia‚'’
of which this legend furnished the subject.

Respecting the authorship ol this Epistle the opinions of critics are divided.
L. Miiller and Ry. accept it as a productiori of Ovid. Lachm. thinks there is
great reason lor doubting this, but does not regard the arguments against it
as absolutely decisive. Palmcr maintains that it was composed by the same
author as Epist. xvi and xvii, while he admits that it is a composition of consid·
erable merit. Dunlop considers it one of the best written and most interesting
epistles in the collection. ’
