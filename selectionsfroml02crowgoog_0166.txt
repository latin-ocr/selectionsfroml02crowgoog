aa] · Catullus. 153

Thessalica prinoe brings into greater refief the atter loneliness of Ariadne, when
itstdiscovered by Bacchus and his crew.

“Or the original motive of both pictures might be sought in the concluding
huswritten in a graver tone than anything else in Catullus: and it might be
supposed that he intended, by the two pictures of dirtne t'aror granted to ntor-
ttkto enforce the lesson thar it is owing to the sins of the latter time that the
gods have withdrawn their gracious presence from the earth. These lines
useel a genuine and unexpected vein of reverence in the nature of Catullus·
The sins which he specifies us alienating the gotis from ttten are those tnost
rie in his own time, with which he has dealt in a more realistic fashion in his
atiric epigranrs

“But on the other hand, Catullus is the least didactic of poets. He is also
theleast abstract and reflective. We cannot suppose (in the case of such a
mter) all the concrete passionate life of the poeni taking shape in his imagina-
tion in order to embody any idea however noble. The idea was the after-
thought‚ not the creative gerat. Nor can we think that the conception of the
whole poem existed in his mind before, or independently of, the separate con·
oepeffihae &titfhe poem be called a successful specimen of narrative. Tbere
is scarcely any story to tell in connection with the marriage of Peleus. lt is a
suecession of pictures‚not a tale of passion or adventure. 'l‘he imaginative
excellence of the poem is idyllic rather than cpic or dramatic. lt abeuntis in

ictures or suggestions of pictures taken from the world of divine and human
&caud of outward nature. Such are those of the Nereids gazing on the Argo,
of Ariadne watching with pale and anxious face the perilous encounter of
'Theseus with the hfinotaur, and again, looking on the distant fleet, of the advent
of Bacchus. a pass-ige which has inspited one of the masterpieces of modern
art, of Prometheus, of the aged Parcae spinning the. thread of human destiny, as
vith clear-ringing voice they poured forth their truthful prophccy.

“The diction aad rhythm of the poem ate characterized by excellences of
quites different sort from those of Catullus’ other pieces. In no previous work
of latin genius was so much use made of an artificial poetic diction, while it is
very effective in its own way. lt reveals new and unexpecfcd wealth in the ore
of the latin language. The rhythm is tuuch more carefully and correctlv stn-
ished than the rhythm of Lucretius. Each separate line lias a smoother cadcncc.
And the poem, asa whole, has a nohlc, calm, and statcly provenient, in anison
with the noble and stately pictures of att ideal fore-time which it brings before

the imagination.”-
