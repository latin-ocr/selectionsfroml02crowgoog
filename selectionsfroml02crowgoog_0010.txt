PREFACE.

—qoe—

HE design of this series os selections from the Ciceronian
poets Catullus and Lucretius, the elegiae writers os the

augustan age, and the epic poet Lucan, is to bring together in
convenient sorm such portions os their writings as may be most
profitable for study in a college course.

These selections are not only free from all impurity of senti·
ment, but they are among the choicest and best productioris of
their respective authors, and may thus be os service also as an
introduction toa critical study os the complete works os these
poets, and in the study of the history os Roman literature.

The text adopted for Catullus is that ol R. Ellis (Oxsord,
1867); for Lucretius that ol H. A. J. Munro (Cambridge,
1873); sor Tibullus that of Rossbach, for Propertius that of
Keil, and lor Ovid that of Merkel (in the Teubner series of
Latin texts); and for Lucan the text ol that author in the
Tauchnitz series. In a lew instances the reading ol some other
editor has been substituted‚ and due mention of the change
made in the notes. To these selections have been added a
briet' notice os the life 3ηά writings of each author and such
explanatory notes as it was judged might be required lor the
pupil, without relieving him of the necessity os an independent
and thorough study of the text itsels.

The sources from which these explanations and comments
have been chiefly derived are indicated in the notes themselves,
