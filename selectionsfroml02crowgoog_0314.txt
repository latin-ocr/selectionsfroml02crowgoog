THE object oi issuiug a new edition is to give the latest results

oi special study in this department, and to make in the gram-
mar whatever improvements have been suggested by ten years' use
under the most varied conditione.

The aim oi the editors and publishers has been to make the
grammar as perfect as suet a boot· possibly cen he. No less ambition
would have justified undertaking any revision oi a work so popular
and satisfactory.

'l'he method of the revision has kept the needs oi the class-roem
always in view. The editors have striven to combine scientific
accuracy with clearness end simplicity ⁰f statement. The lauguage
of the book has been subjected to the closest scrutiny throughout,
and no pains has been spared to make the rules intelligible and
quotahle, without, however, conceding anything to mechanical ways
of presenting grammar.

'l'he eine ot the book has been somewhat increased, but teoch-
ers will find that the matter has been simplified. Simplification
has sometimes brought expansion with it. Things taken for
granted or merely suggested in theold edition have frequently
heen expressly stated in the revision.

Much new matter worthy oi special attention will be found.
In many particulare the new grammar will be recognized as mark·
ing a substantial advance. Attention is invited, for example, to
the chapter on word-Formatiom the treatment oi cum and the
other temporal particles3 the sectiou on Reflexive Pronouns; the
chapter on Order of Words; the Chapter on the Verb3 and
the important subject of Indirect Discourse.
