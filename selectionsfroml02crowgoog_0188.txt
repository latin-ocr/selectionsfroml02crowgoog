Lucretius. 175

tra is capable, subsiding and melting into the most melodious
music, and it has heenostyled “the most magnificent that ever

flowed from human pen.” The description of the seasons far sur· ,

passes Thomson's finest lines upon them, of which it may have ·
been the model. After sketching the primitive life and manners of
mankind, he traces the progress of civilization, of religion, and of the
various forms of government from their rudest beginnings3 in the
spirit of a true Roman who had inherited the ancestral virtues,
setting forth the family as the beginning and the grand means of
human enlightenment, and associating with it music, as a powerful
auxiliary in elevating the race from barbarism to civilized life.

lt is with reference to such portions of the poem as these that
Niebuhr declares that ‘⁴ Lucretius holds the first place among Roman
poets in sublimity”; that Sellar calls him “ the great contemplative
poet of antiquity”; and that Schlegel remarks that “ Lucretius has
shown himself a glorious painter of nature, and as nature's own
minstrel surpasses all the hards of antiquity”; adding that “in

didactic poetry the Romans surpassed their predecessors the
Greeks.'‘

“Die poetical style of Lucretius‚'' Sellar remarks, “is chiefly marked by
heshness and fulness of meaning, and by a daring energy in the use of meta-
phorical expressions. Few poets convey so much meaning by the use of simple

hnished in a style scarcely, if at all, inferior to that of Virgil, such as the intro-
ductions to the first three Books. But long passages in the poem approach
almost as near to the roughness of Ennius. Even the greatest passages are
characteriaed hya monotony of cadence, implying inferior skill in rhythra to
lhat of his greatest successor. Yet there is a kind of grandeur and dignity even
in the monotony of the verse, varied as it is by occasionally deeper and more
majestic torres, or falling into a softer and more harmonious cadence, as the
argument sweeps through the sublimet or the serener and more beautiful
phasea of his subiect?

“Many of the older and clumsier forms are to be met with in his lines.
There are some irregularities of construction: numerous compounds expressive
and forcible, but often not euphoniouS, manufactured to suit the necessities of
the thought, and some of them adopted by no other writer: not unfrequently
the use of words in an antiquated sense or one peculiar to him, occasionally, a
harsh succession of sounds‚ a heaviness of movement through the line, and an
apparently needtess·repetition of epithets. Yet he more than compensatus for
all these defecta by such an ingenious grouping of words as to make the thought
