1. sepulcris, put for nze deadburiedin them- 3. Instead os quo
many editors read quum. desiderio is in apposition with dolore.-
4 missas, lost. Mo. prefers the reading amissas, on the ground that
mittere never has the force ol onriltere. Cf. Cranstoun’s version:

‘⁴ Calvus! if from our grief aught can accrue

The silent dead to solace or to cheer,

When lond regret broods 0'er old loves anew,
And o'er lost friendships sheds the bitter tear

Ohl then her grief at death's untimely blow
To thy Quintilio far, lar less must prove

Than the pure joy her soul must feel, to know
Thy true, unchanging, ever-during love.''

“These elegiae lines, in which Catullus comforts his friend Calvus for the
loss ol Quintilia, bear witness to the strength and delicacy of his friendship, and
along with others of his poems make us leel that the life of pleasure in that age
was not only brightened by genius and culture, but also elevated by pure affec·
tion and unselfish sympathy.'' — SELLAR.
