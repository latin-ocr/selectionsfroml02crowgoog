Floralia was afterwards introduced into Rome (nc. 238) and other cities,
where, besides the feasting and meniment there were theatrIcal and mimic

the country-people continued to celebrate it in the old and merry but inno·

Sustulit immenso ter iubar orbe suum,
Mille venit variis florum dea nexa coronis¹

Exit et in Maias sacrum Florale kalendas.
Tunc repetam: nunc me grandius urget opus.''
