mention of this distant island here, on the ground that Peleus was king oi
Phthia, at the extremity of which lay the Dolopes, who with the Pelasgians
were said to have been among the original inhabitants os Scyros; that the
name Pelasgian was sometimes equivalent to Thessaliam and that Scyros
was intimately associated in the mind of Catullus with the family ot* Peleus,
as the hiding place os the young Achilles, or from the tradition that he
attacked and took Scyros and afterwards lest his child Pyrrhus there, or the
story that Peleus sent him there to avenge the death os Tbeseus. Many
editors adopt the emendation Cieros, the nanre ol an obscure Thessaliau
town. Phthiotica. Phthiotis included the southern part oi Thessaly, and
extended as far north only as Pharsalus and the Thessalian plains; but the
adjective here is poetic ior Thessalian. Cf. v. 285. — 37. Pharsaliam,
according to Es, is the name both ol a town and a district; here oi the
town, as is shown by its use without a preposition, its combination with
Crannon and Larisa, and the use ol the word coeunt, which could scarcely
apply to any place larger than a town. To avoid a change oi quantity in
the same line many editors read Pharsalum, but such a variation (as that
in the antepenult here) is common in proper names, and sometimes occurs
in other words. Cf. Lucretius, IV, 1259 ε liquidis liquido,· Hor. Carm.
