illas Hennenses laem lucosque incolitis. This single, long, loose, ill-
assorted, ill-constructed sentence furnishes one of the proofs that the author
leit his work in an uniinished state. Μο. - 47. flectet . . . gubernans.
cf. v. 107: flectat fiartuna gubernans, which comes to the same thing, as
the Epicurean nature is at one and the same time blind chance and inex-
orable necessity. Mo. — 55. supera, the original form of the preposition,
an ablative singular, feminine, and often found in L. Roby, Ι, 509.-

one of the grandest parts of the poem, is itself ill-constructed and patched

author in an unfinished state, and that he had carefully worked up some

the poem. Mo. — 94. primordia reruni. See Ι, 23, note. - 98. pla-
