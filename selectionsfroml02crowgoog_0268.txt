ovid. 255

“By the dignity and beauty with which the time-honored and sacred festivals
were described in rhts poem, a new charm was thrown arouud them. And its
exhibition of the ehildlike raith, reverence, and sincerity ol worship ol the olden
time, in so attractive a form, the greater inrpressiveness given lo the religious
rites by the historical setting in which they were placed and the information
imparted about them, the portraits ol patriotism and oi private virtue, embodied
in real lite, drawn from the national history, combined to make the Fasti a
didactr'c poem, ol a very profitable kind. Never rising to the heights ol heroic
strains, this poem is ‘the perfectiori oi story-telling' in verse. Many parts ol it
are among the fiuest specimens oi Ovid's composition.”

Quintilian’s comments upon this poet are as follows: Lascivus
quidm in lrcror's quoquc Ovr'dius et nimium atrrator altgenr'r' sui, luu-
dandus tamen in partibus. Ovidii aledea videtur nn'lri ostendere,
qrcantum ille vir praestare potuerit, si r'rrgem'o suo z'nrpcrare quam
indulgere maluisset. X, i, 88, 98. See also p. 196.

By modern scholars also, Ovid has been censured for failing to
“prune the growths of his too luxuriant fancy,” and criticised as
too prolix, repetitions, and redundant, as deficient in masculine vigor
and as aiming too much al urere rhetorical effect. These criticisms,
however, apply chiefly to his, earlier and his latest pieces. Such
departures from the requirements of a pure and correct taste are
found in a less degree in the blasti than in his other works, partly
because of the nature of its plan, partly because his judgment and
taste, when he wrote it, were mature and at their best.

Notwithstanding his defecta, all concede to him au unlabored
gracefulness of style, a wealth of choico diction, a harmony and
ease of versification, unequalled by any other Roman poet. Niebuhr
considers him a master os language and rhythm, and the only Roman
poet who attained complete facility of versificati0n3 and asserts
that in Ovid's hands the eleazar mem reached its highest point of
excellence.

“In point oi originality, variety, and ease, he may be called the greatest ol
the Roman poets. His characteristics as a poet are exuberance ol imagina-
tionan overt'ondness lor description, gracefislness and laste rather than natural
warmth and sensibilitya luxuriant sulness and lreedom os clear picturesque
diction, often marred by the exeess of contrast, antithesis, and point, a perfect
smoothness and simplieity of construction, and a saullless flow os easy, har·
monicus versification‚ especially in the elegiae melre, which in his hands reached
its highest point oi perfection.'' - PtNDER.
