names and forms of these constellations and of the signs of the zo·
diac, also the legends accounting for the name of each of the months3
(r) a mention of noted anniversaries on the day of their occurrence,
such aS, those of the dedication of many of the most celebrated
temples and altars, with descriptions of their divinities‚ and those
of memorable historical events, among them the banishment of the
kings the slaughter of the Fabii, the defeat at Trasymenus by Han·
nibal, the defeat and death of Hasdrubal, of Crassus by the Parthians
Caesar's victory over Juba, Caesar’s death, Augustus' victory at
Mutina, etc.

Thus the subject-matter, though it includes some of the Grecian
myths, is chieflya collection of legends relating to the primitive,
religious, social‚ and civil institutions and customs of Rome, and of
occurrentes belonging to the period of its authentic history. And
on all these subjects this work of Ovid is a storehouse of information
respecting the early Roman character and the religious and civil
polity of Rome ulrich could be obtained from no other source.

The successive pieces are richly·colored pictures of the primitive
life of the Italian race, of religious observances, social customS, and
historic occurrences in the day of austere homely virtues and heroic
lives, arranged, however, in an order determined by the successive

dedication of the temple of Juno Moneta and the career of Marcus Manlius
(the first to drive the Gauls from the citadel), near whose house it stood, on the
calends,· the rising of the Hyades on the and; the dedication of a temple to
Fidius on the nones, and one to Mens (after the early detears in the second
Punic war) on the 8th; on the 9th the observance of the Vestalia with an ac-
count ol Vesta and her worship, associated by the poet with tellus, and suggest-
ing a description of the celebrated sphaera of Archimedes; the victory of Brutus
in Spain and the destruction of Crassus by the Parthians on the same day.
Later on-a festival of Minerva on the ides: the rising of Orion on the 16th,
the defeat of the Roman army at lake Trasymenus on the 23d; the gloomy
picture relieved by the account of the defeat and death of Hasdrubal on the
24th; the occurrence of the Summer solstice on the 26th; and a concluding
address to the Muses, whose statues were in a temple of Hercules dedicated ou
