mox 1.] Lucretius. 177

— 10. Quae. M. 4483 A. 201, e; .G. 6123 l·l.453. - 11. Mo. queries
whether dias can mean either brught‘or open, according to all its ¹analogies
in latin, Greek, aud Sanskrit. Cf. dia voluptas, ll, 172, and prasiorum
...otia diva, V, 435 (1389), the urly other passages where it occurs.
luminis οηα, a favorite phrase to denote the line or horder which divides·
light from darkness, being from non-being. - 13. seribendls versibus,
darive of purpose. A. 299; G. 4303 H. 544, 2, note 2.— 14. derorum
natura. This title L. doubtless gave to his poem in imitation of Epicurus’
great work περὶ φύσεως iu thirty-seven Books, of which only some frag-
meno·- are extant. Tne same title was given hy Empedocles to his chief
poemia three Boolrs, which must in some degree have serred L. fora
model. These two words with corpus and ratio ocem with curious fre-
quency in L. Natura is sometimes an active force or agency; sometimes
an iuert mass 3 sometimes an abstract term; sometimes as in 1, 419, it seems
synonymous with the unane. Res has (with this author) many abstract mean·
ings; but as a physical term it signities composite things in being, in cou-
tradistinction to the primordio or corporo primo out of which things are
made, I, 420, 449, 504 being apparent rather than real exceptions. illatura
mem is therefore coextensire with the summo terma, comprehending
the infinity of worlds in being throughout the oraine, and denoting some-
times the suntme itself, sometimes that universally pervading agency by
which the sunrma goes on. Often tratura means the inner nature and
essence of things. Mo. 15. Memmirrdae, a hybrid word like Scipiadas.
See A. 164, b; II. 3223 M. 183. The apparent contradiction between
this opening address and the philosophical principles of L. hasbeen vari·
0me accounted for. 'lhe most satisfactory explanation is that of Sellar:

“Tm mysterious power here addressed is identified with the Alma Venus
of Italian worship—the abstract conception of the life-giving impulse, the
operations of which are most visible in the new birth of the early spring—and
with the Aphrodite of Greek art and poetria—the concrete and passionate
conception of the beauty and charm which mast fascinate the senses. lf
nothing more was meant in the opening lines of the poem than a fanciful appeal
to one of the Deities of the popular belief, it might with justice be said that
sprne of the finest poetry in Lucretius directly contradicted his sincerest con-
werions

“But the language in which she is addressed clearly proves that the 'siluro
l'enus' of the invocation is not an independent capricious power, separate from
the orderly action of Nature. She is emphatically addressed as a l‘ower,
present through all the world. She is not only omnipresent¹ hut all-creatae
and all-regulative. To this mysterious l'ower¹ from whom all joy and love'ri-
uess are silently emanating, the poet (remembering at the same time that the
tu'end to whom he dedicates his poem claims especially to be umler the pro-
tection of that Goddess with whom she is identified) prays for inspiration. If
to regard this passage as merelv an artistic ornament of the poem would be
unjust to the sincerity of Lucretius as a thinker, to regard it merely as a picce
of elaborate symbolism would be still more unjust to his genius as a poet. lt is
