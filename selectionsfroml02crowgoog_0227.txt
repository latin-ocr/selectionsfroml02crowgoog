214 Notes.

severe attack upon Propertius) must have been occasioned by some
personal dislike, as to the cause of which there have been various
conjectures.

The ninety-one elegies of Propertius are, in all the manuscripts,
divided into four Books. The poems in the second of these Lach-
mann separated into two books, beginning Book ΙΙΙ, with an elegy
(II, 10 of the old notation)‚ which was evidently intended to be the
dedication of a Book to Augustus in parallelism with the first of
Book ΙΙ, an elegy addressed to Maecenas. This new division has
been generally accepted, and is considered undoubtedly correct by
Teuffel in his History of Roman literature. Baehrens and Palmer,
however, the two latest editors of the text, have returned to the
old order, and Postgate argues strenuously in its favor, maintainiug
that the reasons for Lachmann's change “are inconclusive, *refuted
by positive evidence, and little more than an arbitrary surmise.”
So that the case has been reopened, and is still sub iudice.

The poems of Propertius have been grouped, according to their
subjects, in three classes, as follows: 1st‚ Personal, which are
chiefly amatory and addressed to Cynthia, and include most of tlte
first three soors, 2d, Political and Socrul, which are upon events
of the day, andare addressed to Augustus, Maecenas, and others;
and 3d, Hz'slorr'cal and Antiquarian. '

While Catullus had introduced elegiae verse into Latin literature,
and Tibullus had carried it to a high degree of perfectiori, Paley
considers that ‘⁶ to Propertius may fairly be attributed the first suc·
cessful effort to take up this metre uniformly as the best for narrative
as well as for poetic sentiment ”3 and Cruttwell’s opinion is that
“he was the greatest master of pentameter Rome ever produced.
lts rhythm in his hands rises at times almost into grandeur.‘'

‘⁴ There is a strength and sometimes a grandeur in his language which would
have been more highly relished in the sterner age of Lucretius. He stands
alone among the Roman poets in the force and fervor he imparts to elegiae
verse: he alone raises the solt and languid pentameter to the dignity of its
heroic consort. But it is in the weight of single lines and the manly savor ot'
single expressions that the charm of this writer is to be found, while he is defi-
cient in sustained majesty‚ in natural grace, and in flowing rhythm.''.— MERI·

VALE.

¹⁴ Generally harmonious and smooth‚ he now and then adventures a word ol'
four and even five syllables, or two spondees, at the end of his hexameters, and

there is a greater predominance of spondees over dactyls than in Tibullus ond
