Lucretius. 169

and discloses throughout the work, in his diction and rhythm, an
intimate acquaintance with the writings of that poet, and in his
account oi the plague at Athens follows closely the language of
Thucydides.

lt is evident that Lucretius lived avery secluded liie, for no men-
tionis made oi him in his lifetime by any oi his contemporaries3
nor are any other facts respecting him certainly known, except that
hedied October 15, lac. 55.

As to the credibility oi the statement oi Jerome (in his additions
tothe Eusebian chronicle) that Lucretins' work was composed dur-
ing the lucid intervals of insanity occasioned by a ‘¹ love potion,'‘
aad that he committed suicide, the opinions of recent critics are
divided. Teuffel urges cantion against any rash acceptance of these
statements. Lachmann and Cruttwell find nothing incredible in the
story, the latter adding that it ‘⁶ may perhaps meet with a qualilied
acceptance.” Munro seems to doubt, and refers to Sellar's exami-
nation oi the sto'ry, who remarks that it can neither be veritied nor
tet'uted. He is, however, inclined to accept the account “as a
meagre and distorted record oi tragical events in his life.'’

Some oi the personal characteristics of Lucretius of which Sellar
finds indications in his writings— “some glimpses oi his habitual
pursuits and tastes, indirect traces of the impression produced upon
him by the age in which he lived '² - are as follows:

“The tone oi many passages in the poem clearly indicates that Lucretius,
though taking no personat part in politics, was protonndly moved hythe effects
which they produced on human happiness and character. Thus the lines at
111, 70-74 recall the thought and spectacle oi crime and bloodshed presented
to him in the impressible years oi his youth; and other passages are an imme-
diate reflection oi the anarchy and alarm of the times in which the poem was
written.

“One general impression received irom his poem is that oia man who,
iram a strong distaste to the liie oi action and social pleasnre, deliberately chose
the tite oi contemplation.

“Some illustrations oi his argument imply that he had not always been a
stranger to the enjoyments oi city life, and that they attracted him by a certain
fascinatiou oi pomp and novelty. But such illustratibus are rare when com-
pared with those which speak oi a liic passed in the open air, and oi intimate
hmiliarity with many aspects oi nature. Many bright illustrations os his
argument tell oi hours spent by the sea-shore; other passages show his
&miliarity with inland scenes,— with the violent rush oi rivers in flood or their
eatuy tlow through fresh meadows; or, again, with all the processes ot hus·
