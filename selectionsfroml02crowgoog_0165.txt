“But it hasbeen shown (Mnnro's Lucretius, p. 468) that throughout the
poem, and more especially in the episode of Ariadne, there are clear indications
rn sinrilarities of expression which cannot he mere cusual coincidences between
the two, that Catullus had read and imitated the poem of Lucretius, which
appeared about the end of 55 or the beginning of 54 tac. We may therefore
conclude that in 54 B.c.-the last year of his life—Catullus was still engaged
in thg original composition of his longest poem, or in giving to it the finishing
touc es.''

Respecting tlte purpose of the poem also, widely differing opinions
have been advanced. That of Hodgson is:

“The theme of the so-called Marriage of Peleus and Thetis is the glory of
marriage idealized by means of an instance in which all the circumstances of
happiness are united, and which is invested with all the imagined glories of the
heroic age. This theme is exhibrted by the two contrasted stories which thus
pro erly assume almost eqnal irnportance. Thus it is the very marriage-bed
of Peleus and Thetis which is covered with the tapestry exhibiting the story of
Ariadne. Thetis is given in marriage hy Jupiter himself: Ariadne deserts her
father's horne for Theseus. The first union receives its crown in the birth of
an heroic son¹ Achilles; the inconstancy of mind which leads Theseus to desert
Ariadne, in the second, is the cause of his own father's death. Again. tire cir·
cumstance that the uniorr of Peleus and Thetis was a union between a mortal
aad an immortal finds its counterpart in the advent of Bacchus. But though
old wounds may be healed‚ there is no future in tlre picture: while for Peleus
and Thetis the song of the Parcae weaves into the fruition of the present the
anticipated farne of their son.''

The substance of Sellar's discussion of this point is as follows:

“It is difficolt to lind any single motive which combines into unity the
original nucleus of tlte epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis with the long
episode of the ‹lesertion of Ariadne which interrupts the continuity of this
poem. The form of art to which it belongs was due to the invention of the
Alexandrians. But there is no reason to suppose that Catullus is reproducing‚
still less translating, any particular work of these poets. A comparison of the
imagerv of this poem with that of the earlier Epithalamia‚ and a consideration
of the passionate heauty with which the suhject of love and marriage is treated,
favor the conclusion that the style arrd substance of tlte poem are the workman·
ship of Catullus. It may he doubted whether any Alexandriae poet, except
perhaps Apollonius, whom Catullus in this poem often imitates, but does not
translate, had sufficient imagination to produce the original which he is sup
posed to have copied. Indeed, Catullus exercises in this poem a power of
creative pictorial imagination far transcending that displayed tn any of the
extant poetryof Alexandria. But the plan of the poem may have been sug-
gested by some Alexandriae tnodel. The Alexandrians studied pictortal repre-
sentation of outward soenes and of passionate situations, and works of tapestry
on which such representations were wrought were common among their deliciae
vitae.

“Thus Catullus may have intended to paint two pictures of the love of an
immortal for a mortal—the love of Thetis for Peleus, and of Bacchus for
Ariadne-and to heighten the effect of each hythe contrast presented in the

endent picture. The original good fortune and the unbroken. happiness of
Peleus are more vividly realized by the contrast presented to the imaginatron rn
the betrayal aad passionate agitation of Ariadne. The thought of the crowds
ofmortals and immortals who corne together to celebrate the marriage of the
