Among his other literary friends were Virgil, parts ¹of whose
Aeneid he had the opportunity of reading before its publication, and
of whose genius he expresses his admiration in one of his poems
(Ill, 32, 61 seqq), Ovid, Ponticus an epic poet, and others whose

names are mentioned in his works. As Propertius could hardly
