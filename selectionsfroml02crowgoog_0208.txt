NOTES TO TIBULLUS.

—000—

INTRODUCTION.

CCORDIN G to the best authorities the life of Albius Tibullus

extended from 54 nc. to 19 n.c.‚ the year of Virgil's death.

He was of the equestrian order, but of his youth and education
nothing is known,

The large estate at Pedum in Latium, between Praeneste and
Tibur, which he inherited‚ was confiscated in the civil wars‚ but he
retained or recovered a part of it, probably through the intervention
of M. Valerius Messala, the eminent general and statesman‚ on
whose staff he afterwards served in an expedition into Aquitania,
uc. 31, 303 and on this ancestral farm he spent the remainder of
his life.

ln the exercise of his poetic gifts Tibullus was a brilliant mem-
ber of the literary circle of which Messala, himself distinguished as
an author and orator, was the centre, 3ηά shared the patronage of
that illustrious man with Horace, whose friendship and appreciation
of Tibullus' poetic genius found expression in one of his epistles
(1, 4), and ovid, one of whose elegies (Amores, ΙΙΙ, 9) is a beautiful
tribute to the memory of his predecessor in elegiac writing.

The sincerity and strength of Tibullus' attachment to his patron
areattested by some of his finest poems‚ in which Messala's victories
are celebrated. But with this exception he, among all the promi·
nent literary men of that age, maintained a singular independence
of character in relation to the court of Augustus, The historian
Meritale remarks that “throughout his works there is no mention
made either of the emperor or of his ministers and associates‚'’ that
“ he alone of the great poets of his day remained undazzled by the
glitter of the Caesarian usurpation; and traces ‘⁴ the tone of tender
melancholy which pervades his elegies” to the fact that “ he was
pining away in unavailing despondency in beholding the subjugation
of his country.”
