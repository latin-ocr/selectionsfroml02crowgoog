— 25. viduae puellae, widows. cessate, rey'rain, sc. a matrimonio.
As a rule roidows might marry on seriae publicae, though maidens might
n0t; but the days of this festival were reltgr'osi, unlucky for any mar·
riages. Py. See Propertius, XIV, 12, note- 26. puros, unpollnted.

35. haec, llere riter. ultra, sc. finnt,· with quam, = beyond the time
when, ete. - 36. quot pedes. Eaeh couplet of elegiae verse has elenen
sect: therefore the Feralia, the last day of the festival,must have occurred
on the eleventh day from the end of the month, ie. February 18 ; and this
corresponds exactly with one at least of the ancient calendars, in which the
festival is set down for XII Kal. Mart. Ry. pedes, the reading of some
of the Mss, adopted by Py.‚ Ky, Hm.‚ Ry., instead of dies, the reading of
the hest Mss, which makes no sense. nicer is a conjecture of Merkel,
who refers it to the number of places in an elegiae distich in which the
feet are variable3 but Ky. and Py. object to this as forced and artificial.
And as the T nbula Mnffeann gives IX Kal. Mart. as the Feralia, Py.
thinks the easiest way of reconciling the contradictory accounts is to sup-
pose that the first day remained fixed, but that the last varied at different
timeS, according to the number of days which could be conveniently devoted
to the ceremonies. — 37. Hanc lucem, ie. This last day of the festival,
the whole os which was sometimes called Parentalia,with reference to de·
