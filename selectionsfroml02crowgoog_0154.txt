Catullus. 141

Oue of the most elaborate and appreciative critiques upon Catul-
lus is that of Sellar, in his Roman Pocts of the Republr'c. Momm-
mdes characterization of his poems (IV, 702-704) is in part as

'lu this collection we meet with the melodlous lament of the genuine elegy‚
thefestnl poeni in the full pomp of individual aud almost dramatic execution,
thoveall the freshest miniature-painting of cultivated social life, the pleasant
udary unreserved amatory adventures of which half the charm consists in
pnttling and poetizing about the mysteries of love, the delightful life of youth,
siu full cups and empty purses, the pleasures of travel and of poetry, the
tona, und still more frequently, the Veronese anecdote of the town, and the
hunomus Jest amidst the familiar circle of friends. But not only does Apollo
touch the lyre of the poet. he wields also the bow: the winged dart of sarcasm
suares neither the tedious verse-ruaker nor the provincial who corrupts the lan·
tauhun it hits none ruore frequently and more sharply than the potentates
hy whom the liberty of the people is endangered. The short-lincd and merry
moilen euliveued by a graceful refruin. are of linislred art and yet free
lton the repulsive smoothness of the manufactory. The latin natiou has pro·
· duced uo second poet in whom the artistic substance and the artistic form
appear in so symmetrical perfectiori as in Catullus: and iu this scnsc the collec-
tion ol the poenis of Catullus is certainly the most perfect which Latin poetry as
{whole mn show.”
