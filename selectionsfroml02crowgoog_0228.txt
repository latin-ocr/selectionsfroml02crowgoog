Propertius. 215

ona His habit cf using largely words of four, five, or even three syllables at
the end of the pentameter give a character to tbe Propertian as contrasted with
lhe more polished and equable Ovidian distich. One of the chief beauties of
Propertius· style consists in his habit of balancing the concluding noun of the
pentameter by its epithet in the first half of the verse.''-PA1.EY.

Although Propertius took the Alexandrine poets for his model,
and was ambitious to be famed as ‘⁴ the Roman Callimachus,” it is
the judgment of such critics as Teuffel that “ he greatly surpassed
his patterns in vivacity, originallty of mind, and passion ”3 and that
‘⁴ he was a perfect master of pathos, which may be called the soul
of elegy.'’

Postgate in his elaborate analysis of the qualities of Propertius as

ap0et‚ attributes the “obscurity¹’ for which he has been so often ⁴

criticised ‘⁴ to a certain vagueness and indirectness in his manner
of conceiving and presenting an idea, to his desire for brevity, his
disposition to be spasmodic and incoherent,— often leaving his sen·
tences without connecting particles‚ - his fondness for abrupt tran·
sitiotm of thought and eonstmction3 and in singular combination or
alternation with these characteristica to too closea coherence between
the members of sentences - sometimes necessitating the reading of
asentence as a whole, and making it almost impossible to give ita
detailed construction-and to a fulness often degenerating into
redundance‚ due in part to his desire to be emphatic, or to his ten·
dency to exaggeration.”

On the other hand, among his poetic excellences this critic speei-
fieS, “his unusually large vocabulary and the freedom with which
he uses it, the extraordinary originality of his concepimus, the bold·
tfess of his imagery, the modern and even romantic tone in his
employment of sentiment, and the power of awakening sympathy in
his readers ”3 and he contrasts Propertius with his contemporary
and rival elegiasts as follows:

‘⁸ In some respects both Tibullus and ovid may claim the advantage over
Psopertius3 Tibullus for refined simplicity, for natural grace and exquisiteness
of touch: Ovid for the technical merita of execution, for transparency of eon-
stmction‚ for smoothness and polish of expression. But in all the higher
qualities of a poet he is as much their superior.

“Tibullus is seen at his best where he has a theme which gives play to his
delicate sensibility and refined tenderness. Still this delicacy and finish hardly
atone for the absence of robuster excellence. What we miss above all in him
la verlay and imaginative power and boldness
