...Athamantiadae a conjecture of Hertzberg‚ and adopted by Keil,
Haupt, and Miiller. Other editors retain the Ms. reading, quae . . . mi-
nantis aquae, or change to irritantis aqua or aquas. Some also read natat
= natavit, for notat. Ellis proposes Mimantis aquas, “which would fix
the scene ol Paetus' shipwreck at that part ol the coast of Lydia where the
land, which contracts into a narrow neck between Clazomenae on the
north and Teos on the south, again broadeus out into a rocky peninsula
with three bold promontories, Corycium south, Argennum southwest, and
Malaena north. All these are projections of Mount Mimas.'’ “This con?
jecture seems worthy os caresul consideration, both from the number os
the places on the Asiatic coast in which the name Argonnus, Arginous,
Argennos is traceable, and because Propertius is given to following
obscure and out-of-the-way versions os the old legends.'' Cranstoun. notat
= infamat. — 23, 24. These lines seem to point to the other legend oi the
death os Argynnus‚ which represented him as lost while swimming in the
Cephissus in Boeotia. Ellis thinks that the original legend was connected
with the Boeotian coast; that it subsequently extended to the opposite side
of the Aegean, and that Propertius, who had heard the story connected
with both localities‚ indicates in these two lines, somewhat awkwardly, the
connection. He paraphrases the four lines thus: “Paetus was wrecked on
the coast, which retains the name os the lost ArgynnuS, that youth whom
Agamemnon vainly songht to discover, and kept the fleet at Aulis waiting
in the hope os doing so — a delay which caused the death of Iphigenia.'’—
