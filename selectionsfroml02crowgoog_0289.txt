panions and fellow-students during the years of Seneca's tutorship
of the young prince, and on familiar terms for a considerable part
of Nero's own reign.

Whether the stories which have been handed down of their rivalry
in poetic exercises are true or not, it was a fact that Nero astera
time became jealous of Lucan's brilliant talents and popularity asa
writer and deelaimer of verse, and forbade his continuing to give
public recitations of his poetry‚ thus forcing him to a retirement
favorable to the further cultivation of his poetic genius

influenced, perhaps, partly by a feeling of personal resentment,
and partly by a love of the old republican liberty which the teach·
ings of Cornutus had nurtured within him, Lucan became a party
to the plot of Calpurnius Piso against the emperor's life, was be-
trayed with his fellowconspirators, and was compelled to die, in
nu). 65, at the age 0f twenty-six.

He has been charged with the unuatural and atrocious meanness
of falsely accusing his mother (with others) of participating in the
conspiracy, in the hope of thereby saving his own life3 and this
charge has been accepted as true by many modern writers. But
Merivale remarks respecting it: “Such charges, it must be remem-

grace a commiserated victim.'' And another writer (Lundon Quart.
Reda, 1869) observes: ‘⁶ Contemporary history is generally little bet·
ter than a compilation of anecdotes Such a story may easily have
been invented by a party whose conscience was haunted with the

it was suggested by the real factos the mother's influence over her
son3 by the conviction that it was through his connection by her with
the ancient aristocracy that he was seduced from the views which
properly belonged to his position and his paternal ancestors.”

Upon the purity of Lucan's private life no imputation has ever
been cast. Respecting this Merivale's words are: “ By 'literature
and possibly by domestic interests Lucan seems to have been saved
from the contagion around him. No Roman poet dwells with such
warmth as he on the sentiment of conjugal affecti003 which may
be taken as a tribute perhaps to the merits of a consort worthy of
his genius.” Ι

The PHARsAmA (entitled in the Mss.‚ De Bello Ctbt'li), Lucan's
only extant productiori, is an epic poem of about 8000 lines, in ten
