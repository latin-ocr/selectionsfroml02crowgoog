naum sexu-soors. 29

Quanttty. - The quantity of all vowels known to be long by
nature has been marked throughout the boolr (see Preface).

Examplee. - The examples have been greatly increased in num·
ber, and their scope broadened (see List of Abbreviations at end
of Index).

crosa-references. - The revised edition has been furnished
with very numerous crossreferences, by means of which the ramifi-
cations of a construction, etc„ can easily be traced. In the same
way references have been inserted in the grammatical analyses at
the head of each chapter.

Typography.-The peges of the new edition are much more
open than those of theold, and in many other points the typograph-
ical arrangement of the present edition will, it is hoped‚ be found
to aid the learner.

Indexes.— The Index of Words and Subjects has been much
enlarged and carefuiiy revised, aud a separate Index of Verbs has
been added. The Glossary of Terms has also received some addi-
tions. The hist of Authors has been divided into periods.

Liet of rulee. — The list of important Rules of Syntax has been
made much more complete, and has been furnished with references
to the body of the book. In its present form this list will, itis
hoped‚ fumish the pupil with a convenient and accurate summary.

Section numbers-With perhaps half, a dozen exceptione at
the beginning, the section numbers of the new edition correspond
with those of theold, so that references to either edition are good
for the other, and the two editions can be used in the same class.
