Ovid. 25 3

though less perfect in diction aad metre than his other writings‚
they are entirely free from impurity‚ and contain many passages of
great poetic beauty.

The Heroides are imaginary letters from women of the heroic or
legendary age to various heroes- their husbands or lovers. ef the
twenty-one epistles making up this collection, only the first fourteen
are now considered certainly genuine, and the authorship of two or
three of these is stilla matter of dispute. These productioris are
ingenious in their structure, and are remarkable for their smooth-
ness of versification.

‘⁰ In the ‘Arethusa' of Propertius (XIV) the soenes and incidents are laid in
real life. Hence Ovid clnims for himself the invention of this speeies of com·
position, though it is in fact merely a new form of the clegy. But the epistolnry
form bestows on ita propriety‚ interest, and animation, of which the elegy or
even a well-conducted soliloquy in Thagedy is scarcely suseeptible. Tne art

which affords scope for a display of the most render sentiments as well as the
most sudden and violent changes of passion? — Debitor.

of their purity and depth of feeling. The boves of the Heroines is the most
elevated and refined in sentiment of all elegiae compositione of the Romans.'‘

The Fasti, written in elegiae metre, is a poetieal year-book or
eompanion to and commentary upon the almanae, on the plan of
one book for each month (cf. blasi. ΙΙΙ, 57), though only six books
(January to June) were finished nt the time of Ovid's banishment.
This portion of the work hc revised at Tomi, but there is no reason
tobclieve that he ever completed his original design. But cf. T rr'st. ΙΙ,
549, et seqq. ’ ln correspondence with tho contents of tho Calendar,
this work of Ovid consists of (a) a mention of the annual religious
festivals (to the number of about forty)‚ on the day of the month
of the occurrence of each, with nn account of their origin, their
nature, significance, ritcs and ceremonies; (b) a mention of the
time of the rising and setting of about thirty-five of the most im-

signs of the zodiac‚ with an account of the myths explaining the
