248 Notas. [xvi.

African and Spanish successes of the two Scipios‚ Africanus Major and
Minor. loquuntur, are eloquent about. — 31. altera turba, i.e. the
ancestry on the mother’s side. The Libones were members of the Scribo·
nian gens. exaequat, i.e. pares sarit paternis avis. Py.; used absolutely,
which is very rare. — 32. titulis, literally, cominemorative inscriptions.
Pe. But see Lex, s. a. ll, A. Both farnilies alike rest on their titles, i.e. so as
not to come to extinction or obscurity. Py. - 33. praetexta, the dress of
childhood‚ exchanged at marriage for the stola of the matron. - 34. ao·
captas, caught by, arken up. altera vitta. The form of the matron's
vilia differed from that of the maiden. - 35. slo, only thus to be parted,
i.e. by death. cubili, to be taken with lungor. - 36. hoc. So the Mss.
Cornelia is supposed to point to her gravestone. Lachm. and others read
huic. legar, future here. - 38. titulis. Under the inscription at the
base of a statue or trophy commemorating the exploits of Scipio Africanus
we must suppose a symbolical sculpture of Africa to have been placed,
represented as a woman (a female slave or captive), prostrate, with hair
shorn in token of grief. Py. Cf. v. 32.— 39. The construction is: et
(eum testor qui fregit) Persen tuasque, O Persa, domos Achille pro-
avo ortas. Hertzb. The allusion is to L. Aem. Paullus, the conqueror of
Perses and ancestor of Cornelia's husband. Instead of simulantem
Achillis, the reading of Keil, Palmer, and Py., Pe. reads scintulantem
Achilli, and instead of tuas proavo (v. 40), the Ms. reading, accepted by
Keil and Palmer, Py. reads trias proavus, and takes Achille as avoca·
tive, which the quantity of the final e seems to forbid. Pe. reads tremens
proavo: while he argues against the reading of Averna for Achille in
Munro’s discussion of the passage in the Journal of Philol. (VI, pp. 5 3-62).
— 41. mollisse, aueahened, i.e. have not been the cause of my husband's
relaxing the severity of the censorship through any fault of mine which he
ought to have punished. Py. — 42. labo, stain. - 43. damnum, i.e. she
did not impair the lustre of these honors. Pe. The dative would be regu·
larly used in prose. - 44. i.e. great as was the family, she was herself even
a pattern of virtue in it. Py.

‘¹ Ne'er censor bent the law to screen my shame;
Your hearth was aye the shrine of honor fair:
No slurl brought upon your stainless name;
Your house was noble —l the pattem there.'' —- CRANSTOUN.

- 45. Mea aetas = l throughout my life. Pe. mutata, sc. for the worse.
- 46. lnter utramque facem, from the bridal to the funeral lorch. —
47. Mi natura.. .duetas, ie my virtue is natural and inherited, not
assumed through fear of punishment. Pe.
