ot morality, in the last part ot Book IlI. One ol these is the necessity oi virtue
for man's welfare; for the fear of death and what lies beyond is the inevitablr
effect of an evil course of life and a guilty conscience, and cannot be thrown off

. except by virtuous living. Another is fortitude, and resignation to that whicl

is the common lot of all. A third is the importance of making the most of lifr
iu the best sense, since this life is all we have. Still another is the certainty tha*
wrong-doing is overtaken by retribution in this life, in the necessary misery of a
character nrorally diseased and discordant with itself. The scorpion stings ol

The clrz'ef poetic excellences of this work are to be found in thr
introductions to the several Books¹ particularly the first and second

ence from them that the earth is not eternal nor fashioned by th
gods but the product of nature built up by certain laws from th«
ultimate atonis and therefore having a beginning and destined tr
have an end, he proceeds to sketch its “ wondrous past '² from th<
dawn of creation, with its most striking phenomena, beautiful, awful
or grand, and the history of man, -a broader and loftier theme fo
a true Epic than the career of any one race of men, short lived anv
