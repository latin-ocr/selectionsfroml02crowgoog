Lucan. 277

Books, on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, which follows
in the main the historica] order of events. Only the first three
Books were published by the author himself, and the tenth was left
incomplete at his death.

The first four Books extend from the opening of the war to the
decisive campaign in Greece, and, after specifying the causes of the
war, contain in the first two books an account of Caesar's passage
of the Rubicon, and pursuit of Pompey and his partisans through
Italy to Brundusium, and in the third and fourth the story of the
siege of Massilia and the campaign in Spain.

Of the next four Books, the fifth and sixth are chiefly occupied
with the siege of Dyrrhachium, the manoeuvres of the two hostile
armies in Epirus and Thessaly, and the seventh and eighth with the
battle of Pharsalus and the fllght 3ηά death of Pompey.

ln the last two books are narrated the movements of the rem-
nants of Pompey's forces under Scipio and Cato io Africa and in

that country, and the voyage of Caesar to Egypt, his experience of -

siege in Alexandria, his capture of Pharos, 3ηά the continuance of
the war.

The character of this poem is fairly discussed and its chief defects
pointed out and commented upon by Merivnle and Cruttwell.

The former (Chap. LlV) touches upon Lucan's partisanship of
the Senate rather than of the people, his affectation of encyclopaedic
knowledge, his ever-recurring pictures of physical suffering, and his
vague and uncertain views of philosophy3 yet adds: “The reality
of the future life as a state of retribution is strongly set forth in
many passages. The poem, considering the atmosphere of volup-
tuousness in which he moved‚ is singularly free from all indelieacy
of thought and langmge, 3ηά its purity is equal to that of⁴ the
Aeneid. Lucan's moral perceptions are a very fair reflection of the
teaching of his masters the Stoics.”

Cruttwell specifies among the worst faults of the Pharsalia, the
unfitness of the theme for epic treatment, its lack of unity, the
author's tirades on commonplace themes, his skeptical tone, his
love for the ghastly and the revolting, his habitual exaggeration,
and the total deficiency of his poetical art in variety. This critic,
however, also remarks:

'¹ Poetry of the first order the Pharsalia certainly is not, but those who will
forgive artistic defects for energy of thought and strength of feeling muskakwm
