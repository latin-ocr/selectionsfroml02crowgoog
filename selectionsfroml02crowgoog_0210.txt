Tibullus. 197

was free from any pedantic display os learning; he surpassed in the
expressiones patriotic and religious sentimenta in appreciation of
natural scenery and country tite and in sympathy with those in mis·
fortune, and excelled both his rivals in purity os triste, and in a
style unstudied‚ simple, graceful‚ the natural expression oi genuine
and strong feeling.

‘¹ Tibullus is preeminently Roman in his genius and poetry. His disregard
for foreign models, his genuine love ior country seenery and domestic life, his
dignified independence of position and tone, the simplicity of his tastes and
pursuits, and his faith in the national divinities, distinguish him from all his
contemporaries, and most of his suecessors. He is the natural poet of warm,
tendet, and simple feeling. Neither Greek mythology nor Alexandrine learning
had any attractions for his purely ltalian genius. llis language may be limited
in range and variety; but it is terse, clear, simple, and popular. His con-
structions are plain and direct

“While in point of natural ability, in learning, force, and variety, Tibullus is
tar inferior to Catullus, yet in purity of taste, in the exquisite smoothness of his
lines, and his compact management ol the elegiae system, Tibullus made a
great advanee, in versification, at least, on his predecessor. ln short, his excel-
lence lay mainly in this, that he was the first to clothe in the foreign dress of
the elegiae metre, a body of purely Roman sentiment, imagery, and ideas.''—
Pinnas.

“Tibullus cannot, it is true, soar into the blue heaven and gaze upon the
sun in his meridiari splendor, like that eagle ol the Alps, ‘the young Catullus ';
he has not the vast learning, nervous vigor, and sparkling brillianey of Proper-
tius: nor the exquisite pathos, rieltness of imagery, and intensely sensuous
feeling of the many-minded Ovid; but he evinces throughout a simplieity, a
naturalness, a tendemcss, and a terseness peculiarly his own; and herein lies
his charin,

'¹ His love of home and friends, his enjoyment of the country, of hills and
dales, of shepherds and sheepfolds, oi smiling meadows and murmuring rivulcts,
of purple vineyards and yellow eom-fields, and of the innoeence and simplicity
of earlier days, combined with that tender melancholy that ever, cloud-like,
thren a shadow o'er his bron, gives him an almost romantie interest in the eyes
of the modern render, and will always secure for him, with lovers of rural
scenes, one oi the most enviable positions among the sons of ancient song.” -

Cnansnoou.
