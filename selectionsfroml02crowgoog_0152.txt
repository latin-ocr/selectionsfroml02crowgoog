NOTES TO CATULLUS.

-oooe-

INTRODUCTION.

AlUS VALERIUS CATULLUS was born in Verona, in the
year 84 n.c., probably of a wealthy senatorian or equestrian

family. His father was one of the principal men of the province,
ud an intimate friend of Julius Caesar.

His native district, Gallia Cisalpina, was even at that time one
(tf “the chief literary centres of ltaly”; not a few of the latin

authors of this Golden Age of Roman literature were natives of it,
among them Cornelius Nepos, the biographer, Bibaculus, a writer
uf satiric iambics, aud later, Virgil, Livy, Cornelius Gallus, one of
the eminent elegiae writers, Aemilius Macer, and other poets3 and
there, so far as is known, Catullus was educated.

With the exception of occasional visits to his villas—one at
Sirmio on Lake Benacus, the other on the border of the Tiburtine
aud Sabine territory— and to Verona, his residence from about the
year 61 ac. was at Rome.

ln this period of the ascendancy of the so-called first triumvirate
the sympathies of Catullus, though he took no partin politics, were
entirely aud strongly with the party of the Republic, as not only his
bold attacks upon Caesar, Mamurra, Piso, and others, but also his
personal friendships (for the most part) bear witness. In the circle
of his associates or acquaintances were the orator Hortensius,
Cicero, the consulars Manlius Torquatus and Metellus Celer,
Caelius Rufus, an orator and iu public life. the poets Licinius Cal-
vus, Helvius Cinna, and Asinius Pollio (who was however an adhe·
rent of Caesar), afterward very eminent also as an orator, historian,
and patron of learning.

lu the society of such friends as these, men of intellectuai ability
and culture, and of social and political prominence, Catullus devoted
himself to poetic composition, and all or nearly all his extant poems
vere written after his removal to Rome.
