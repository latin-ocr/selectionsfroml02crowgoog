popular saith in a capricious tyranny of the gods over the world), and that there
is any virtue in outward worship, rites, and offerings; yet many passages show
or imply that he believes in the existence of superhuman intelligenoes, the
embodiment of what is right and pure and noble in man, composed of the
finest and purest essence, exempt from death, superior to passions and desireS,
and dwelling forever in untroubled serenity and in unelouded light. Tireir
abode he beautifully describes in Book Ill. Tm universe, however, has not
been created and is not regulated by them.

'‘But all things have their origin in and are composed of certain minute
solid atoms, always existing, indestructible, infinite in number, various in form,
imperceptible to the senses, capable of certain combinations with each other
brought about by their perpetual motion in space, and causing the growth and
change of all things. lnto these, all things now existing are ultimately resolved,
and out of them new forms continually arise. These original particles he calls
primordia, materies, corpora genitalia, semina rerum, corpora prima?

‘¹ This theory of atoms is really deduced from and has involved in it aud
underlying it the idea of universal order or law and causation in nature. This
idea is prior to and the condition of the principles enunciated in the first and
second Books, although the fact of universal order is supposed to result from
J these propertics of atoms. Thus the real subject of the poem is maiestas cognita
rerum-the discovered majesty or order of the universe. And the comer-
stoue of the argument is, that no existing thing was formed out of nothing, nor
any change or event brought about arbitrarily by divinities with the passions or
caprices of men, and that all existing things and changes are not the result of
chance, but of certain regular and orderly processes, dependent upon certain
primal conditionS.

“But Lucretius's idea of law in nature also implies, at least, the further idea
of power. A secret force, analogous to volition in man, is conceived to be
inherent in these primal atoms. With unconscious inconsistency with the blind
and dead materialism on which his philosophy professes to be based, he tacitly
assumes the presence of a secret faculty in the atoms distinct from their other
properties. And thus he is led up (whether or not this is consciously realized
by him) to the broader and higher idea of will.

¹¹ ln his idea of nature there is implied the idea of a concealed omnipotence
pervading the world, and to this nature he attributes not only life but creative

* The germ of tlte atomt'c theory is attributed to Leucippus, was next taught by
Democritus, and fully developed by Epicurus. But his works are lost to us; so that this
most astonishing fruit of ancient thought, which has been adopted and substantiated by
modern experimentnl science, is to be found fully described only in Lucretius's poem. Tne
propositions in which he has stated this theory anticipare some recent scientific discoveries
in a most marvellous way. His doctrines of the existence os atoms and their indestnicti·
bility, and of their incessant motion, is uow accepted by science as certainly true. His
proposition, that matter was never more or less deuse thau it is now, and that the atoma
always move with the same velocity, foreshadows the modern doctrine of the conservation
of energy. And Lucretius must be allowed great merit in having taught that the motion
of matter was as indestructible as its material existence- North anislt Κηίου.
