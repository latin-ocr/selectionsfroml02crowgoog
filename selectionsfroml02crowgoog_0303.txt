“There are two passages in Lucan which surpass in eloquence anything
that l know in the Latin language. One is the character which Cato gives 01
Pompey: Civis obit, etc.,— a pure gem 01 11810110 without 0118 flaw, and in my
opinion not very sar from historical truth. The other is the enumeration 01
Pompey's explens, in the eighth Book (806-8) :

“ ¹ Quod si tam sacro dignaris nomine saxum,
Adde actus tantos, monimentaque maxima rerum:
Adde truces Lepidi motus, Alpinaque bella,
Armaque Sertori, revocato consule, victa,

Et currus, quos e it eques: commercia tuta
Gentibus, et pavidos Cilicas maris. Adde subactam
Barbarium, gentesque vagas, et quidquid in Euro
Regnorum Boreaque iacet. Dic semper ab annis
Civilem repetisse togam: ter curribus actis
Contentum patriae multos donasse triumphos.

Quis capit haec tumulus l'

“Tm dream 01 Pompey in the seventh Book 1 vs. 7-44) is also a very noble
piece 01 writing. l hardly know an instance in poetry 01 80 great an effect pro·
(luced by means so simple. There is something irresistibly pathetic in the lines:

“ ¹ gualis erat populi facies clamorque laventis,
lim quum iuvenis primique aetate trium hi
Post domitas gentes, quas torrens ambit l rus,
Et quaecumque fugax Sertorius impulit arma,
Vespere pacato, pura venerabilis aeque
Quam currus ornante toga, plaudente senatu,
Sedit adhuc Romanus eques;'

and something unspeakabty solemn in the sudden turn which follows:

‘⁴‘ Ne rumpite somnos,
Castrorum vigiles: nullas tuba verberet aures.
Crastina dira quies, et imagine moesta diurna
Undique funestas acies leret, undique bellum!

‘¹ When 1 consider that Lucan died at twenty-six‚1 cannot help ranking him
among the most extraordinary men that ever lived.'' - MACAULAY.
