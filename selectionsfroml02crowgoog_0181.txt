NOTES TO LUCRETIUS.

-οοο-

INTRODUCTION.

LUCRETIUS CARUS was bom near the close of the year
ο 99 B.c., or early in the year 98; but the place of his birth
and his parentage are unknown.

He speaks in his poem of the Latin as his native language
(I, 8313 Ill, 260) 3 and it has been inferred from his gentilic name,
which does not seem to have become common in other parts of
Italy, that he was descended from one of the most ancient patrician
houses of Rome, famous in the early annals of the Republic. Sellar
remarks:

“The whole tone of his poem indicates his position as that of a man living
in easy circumstances and familiar with the life of pleasure and luxury, though
repelled by it; and so he must have belonged either to a senatorian or to one
of the richer equestrian families.”

Lucretius was an intimate friend of C. Memmius Gemellus, upon
whose staff, when propraetor of Bithynia, Catullus served, and who
was consul in 54 rac. Of about the same age, it has been con·
jectured that they were associated in their early education and were
held together by their common literary tasteS, for Memmius was
eminent in literature and oratory‚ though he became notorious for his
profligacy; and to him Lucretius dedicated his one and only work.

Respecting his literary studies, the only source of informationis
his poem, in which he shows himself a profound student and admirer
of Epicurus and Empedocles, makes frequent allusions to the Stoice,
discusses doctrines of the philosphers Democritus, Anaxagoras, and
Heraclitus, not only mentions Homer among the poets as sceptra
potitus, but imitates him and Euripides in numerous passages, pays
graceful tribute to his countryman Ennius in the words

'⁶ Ennius ut noster cecinit qui primus amoeno
detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam,
per gentis Italas hominum que clara clueret '’·- 1. 117-119,
