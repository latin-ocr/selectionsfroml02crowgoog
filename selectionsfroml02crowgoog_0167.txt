oi Achilles their son.

Corrclusion .· 384-408. The contrast between the presence of the gods upon
the earth in the golrien age oi purity and virtue, and their withdrawal in the
degenerare age ot' the poet, in consequence ot the wickedness oi mankind.

“With the exception ot one or two short passages, where the movement of
the narrative drags, or the imagery is over-elaborated, the poem is masterly in
design and treatment. T he opening is brilliant and pictoresque; the episode
oi Ariadne grandly passionate; the introduction of the celestial guests towards
the close susrains the interest, which aiter the strain ot' high passion with which
that episode is wrouglrt¹ would have been apt to flag3 tlre description of the
Parcae and their cham, with tlre solemn rnonotony of its reirain¹ is almost
Homeric in iorce and picturesqueness; and tlre concluding lament ior the witli-
drawal ot the gods from carth is, in truth¹ what Gifford lias terrned it, ¹ grand
burst of poetry.' Surely the criticism is oi a shallow kind which comp ains that
the episode of Ariadne occupies a disproportionate space. ln the number oi
lines it may be long relatively ιο the rest o the poem, but this is compensated
by thc fire and rapidity oi the movement.'' — MAR‘rlN.

1. Peliaco. Pelion was the mountain in Thessaly overhanging Iolcos,
which furnished the timber os the Argo. - 5. avertere, to carry off by
force or fraud. — 7. palmis, oar-blades. — 8. Diva, sc. Pallas. qut·
bus, refers to lecti iuvenes, v. 4. - 10. inflexae carinae, to tlre well·
curvedkeel. — rr. illa, the ship Argo. cursu prima imbuit, was tlre
first to navigate. See Lex„ s. Imbuo, II, B. 2. Some interpretem take
Amphitriten in its personal meaning: initiated unsclrooled Amphitrite in
voyafflng. Sn. and Pr.; it was then that Amphitrite gave to tlte untauglrt
prow the first lesson in voyaging. Es. The inconsistency oi this line with
the descriptions of Theseus as a voyager (v. 53 and 212) is one of the
few anachronisms occurring in Catullus, compared with similar errors in
other Roman poete-12. proscidit, used in agriculture ol the first
plowing. See Lex„ s. a. I, B. and ci. Virg. Georg. Ι, 97; hence here,
of the first ship that plowed the sea. — 14. feri, the Ms. reading, wilt
with amazement. Pr.; or, because they belong to the children of the wilt
sea. Es. vultus with which it agrees is best taken as an appositive with
Nereides.

“ Out of the creaming surges in amaze
Wild iaces rose on that strange sight to gaze—
The N ereids of the deep.'' - MARTlN.

Weber refers vultus to the Tritons and other sea deities‚ but in that case
the asyndeton in the next line is objectionable. Mo, on the ground that
feri cannot stand, and that vultus must be an accusative, t'ollows Haupt
in substituting freti and makes vultus the object of emanere, on the
analogy os emergere se, though he admits that this construction is not so
