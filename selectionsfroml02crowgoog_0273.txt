THE FAST1.* I. 1-140.

1-26. A FORMAL dedication of the poem to Caesar Germanicus
(b. 15 13.c., d. 19 Ala), the son of Drusus, nephew and adopted son of the
emperor Tiberius, and heir to the throne; composed (with the exception of
vs. 1, 2, 7, 8, 13, and 14, which perhaps formed the original commence-
ment) soon after the death of Augustus, AD. 14, probably for the purpose .
of inducing Tiberius, through the intercession of Germanicus, to recall the
poet from exile·

Germanicus' father, Drusus Claudius Nero, and the emperor TIBERIUS
Claudius Nero were the sons of Tiberius Claudius Nero and⁴ Livia Drusilla,
afterwards the third wife of Auousrus

The emperor Cununrus was a brother of Germanicus3 and the latter
by his wife Agrippina I (daughter of M. Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the
daughter of Augustus) was the father of the emperor CAL1GULA and of
Agrippina II, the mother of the emperor NERO (by her first husband Cn.
Domitius Ahenobarbus), who was afterwards the wife of her uncle the
emperor Chaonius

* Usus or riis Wono Fasti.

1. The Roman calendar or almanac (sometimes called Fasti Calendaresl: which con-
tained an enumeration of the months and days of the year in regular order, with a letter
attached to each indicating whether it was Faetus, Nalastus, intercisas, Comitatus, or
Ater, the position of the Nonas, ldes, Nundinae, and different Festivals; frequently,

' also, astronomical observations on the risings and settings of the fixed stara, the time of

the equinoxes and solstices, and the commencement of the seasons; and sometimes brief
notices of important events.

Several specimens of such Fasti on stone, more or less perfect, have been discovered,
but none of them older than the Augustan Age. One of them, the Tabula Maffeana.
which dates from mn. 3 or 5, contains the twelve months complete.

2. Fasti Airnales or Historici. -The most important of these were the Annales
Maximi, chronicles in which were recorded the names of the chief magistrates for each

year, together with a short account os remarkable events and the days on which they
occurred. And in prose-writers sasti is commonly employed as the technieal term for
such registers of magistrates, which formed part of the public archives.

Fasti Capitolini is the name given to a number of fragments os marble tablets dis·
covered in excavating the Roman forum and deposited in the Capitol, which contain a list
of consuls, dictatore, censorS, triumphs, etc, from the establishment of the Republic to the
death of Angustus, though defective in many places. It was executed probably at the
beginning of Tiberius' reign. ’

Similar collections, derived from different sources, have received the names of Fasti

ν υἶ Consulares, Fasti Triumphales, etc.
