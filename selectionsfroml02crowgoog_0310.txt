inferior to those os Virgil in correctness and flow. Their beauty is rather that
oi single lines than ol a complex system. ln Carm. 64, and especially in Cam.
62, he shows himself as great a master of the full-toned and stately hex·
ameter as in his smaller poems he had proved his command os the lighter
forms of verse; and he paved the way lor the smoother cadences and statelier
measures ol Virgil. Yet the recurreuce, occasionally, of one monotonous ca·
dence, line after line, gives an air ol sameness, which might almost be called
inartistic. Sometimes lt is relieved hythe spondaic endin s, which he and other
poets of his school tor a time made popular, and someti s by verses ol a treer
and more luxuriant rhythm. Apparently to avoid the irregularities of older
poets, he made the accent (as a rule) agree with the ictus in the last three leet
ol the line, thus giving his verses greater uniformity but producing a monotonous
effect. Alliteration is also quite frequent!

VIII. Murus or rua Arrrs. In Carm. 63; the only specimen ol this
metre in the Latin language. It consists in theory of two iambic or ana·
creontic dimeters‚ of which the first is catalectic, and the second brachycata-
lectic. There are thus six feet, which are usually anapaest, iambic, bacchio,
anapaest, tribrach, iambic, but with some variatious. Roby‚ School Latin

'⁴ ln poetry, the Ciceronian period was distinguished from the Ante-classical
Age, not so much by the mere imitation ol Greek models as by the minute care
with which the rules and niceties of Greek diction, grammar, and mette were
studied and applied, and hya growing perception of the predominaut import-
ance ol form in art. Catullus was moulded hy this spirit and tendency, and was
its best representative, as the linish oi all his linest poems testily. His metres
convey the idea ol a wild freedom nuder a careful and masked regularity; and
while heis less artificial he is more artistic thau any oi his successors. He
exhibits a sense ol freedom workiug by rule, but not dominated by it, not attained
by any other poet.'' Es.

phoses, use the elegiae distich.
