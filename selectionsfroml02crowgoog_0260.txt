Hertzb.—19-20. Py. calis these verses exceediugly difficolt, and con·
denses from Hertzberg's commentary the following interpretation: “⁴ Or,
ii I am to undergo a trial (my asserted innocence not being taken for
granted), and it there be indeed an Aeacus to judge the dead, let him
punish my shade according to its deserts by the appointment oi a jury (by
drawing from an urn the names os the jrnlices) ; and let Minos and Rha·
damanthus act as assessors.' In this complicated allusion to the judicial
forms of the praetor’s court, the reader will obserse that Aeacus is the
quaesitor who appoints the jury by putting the names to be drawn, written
on a ballot (pila), into an urn; that the jury are supposed to be taken
from the shades os the dead; that vindicare in aliquem can only mean to
punish: and that this sense in fact suits the context best, oret (s. 19) im·
plying ‘or it I aru guilty,’ etc.; that sortito pilo is the same as sortiendis
iudicibus, the participle being used in a passive sigirir'rcation.‘' Pe. ex-
plainsquts as: transacti persen as, takes ludex in its proper sense oi
juror or actingjndge, urna as either tlie sterling nrn (as iu v. 49) or the
one containing the names os the accused, which decided the order in which
the trial came on, aud which was placed narr Aeacus, and sortitu pila,
as tlte drawing by let tlte boll inscribed resin nry neena. See ky, pp. 291-
294. — 21. adsiduam, ie. act as assessores, jurists who sat by the side oi
the magistrate on the tribunal to adsise him on points oi law. Minoide,
here, but nowhere else, an adjective. — 22. Eumenidum, sc. as execu-
tioners oi the sentence. Interrto foro, in tln· listening eeinrt. Py. -
23. orbes, ite resolutiores of tlte relieel. Pe. — 24. Tantaleo. So the
Mss‚ Hertzb, Lach, and Py. It must be a substantive form representing
the Greek Τανταλέω from a supposed Greek original Τανταλέως; with
corripiare, ieronymi he careglet lyr Tantalus. Py. On the ground that this
supposition respecting Tantarleo is without authority, Kuinoel and Miiiler
emend the text, reading corripere are. — 25. petat, atteret. improbus,
relentless. - 26. irweat, lie loose on the ground. tacita seru, the pod-
Iock of the door, to which it is attached, censes to rutile. Pe. See Rh, s.
Sera. - 27. sororum, here ela· Danaides.

29. Cornelia's plea before the court. “But the poet has not maintained
the persona loqeeens with perfect consistency, as the appeal to her· children,
and still more, her advice respecting their conduct toward their stepmother
and to her husband have nothing to do with a deience.'' Py. Instead of
per tropaea, the genitive or ea· with forna would be the regular eon·
struction. decori fult, ‹rrierned .· less common than deero sor tlee deordi-
sying thing. Pe. — 30. Afra Numantinos awos, 'rs an abhus'xon aa cae
